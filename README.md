# WPS_Project_CourseOutucome_Analysis
WPS_Project_CourseOutcomeAnalysis
This project is used to calculate the achieved course outcome for every course. It is useful in an educational organization to analyze the percent of outcome from students. Students are examined in 3 tests - 2 internals and 1 external(semester end exam). Every question in each test is associated with a specific course outcome (There are 5 course outcomes, 1 for every unit) Upon enetering marks that each student obtained in every question (each question is out of standard marks), the percent of course outcome achieved for every exam, as well as the overall (after semester end exam) is shown. It can be downloaded as pdf and also analysed graphically using bar graphs generated. Admin can set deadlines to upload the data, which will be intimated to others via auto-generated mail. A spreadsheet can also be uploaded directly. The application reads data from the spreadsheet and does the same calculation. Mysql database was used backend. Table names have a specific format. One table is to store user details, another to map to the subjects they teach. Student table and table for exams are also to be maintained.
